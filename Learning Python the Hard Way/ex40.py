# Notes

''' Why do I need self when I make __init__ or other functions for classes?
If you don't have self, then code like cheese = 'Frank' is ambiguous. That code isn't clear about whether you mean the instance's cheese attribute, or a local variable named cheese. With self.cheese = 'Frank' it's very clear you mean the instance attribute self.cheese. '''
